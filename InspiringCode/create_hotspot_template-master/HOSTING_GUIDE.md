# VR Hotspots Hosting Feature

## 🌐 Automatic Project Hosting

The professor dashboard now includes automatic hosting functionality that allows you to deploy student VR projects to live URLs instantly.

### How It Works

1. **Student submits project** via the "📤 Submit to Professor" button
2. **Professor reviews** submissions on the dashboard
3. **Professor clicks "🌐 Host"** to deploy the project live
4. **System automatically**:
   - Extracts the project ZIP file
   - Deploys it to a live URL
   - Makes it accessible to anyone with the link

### URL Structure

When you host a project, it becomes available at:
```
http://yourdomain.com/hosted/[custom-path]/index.html
```

**Examples:**
- `http://localhost:3000/hosted/john_smith/index.html`
- `http://yourdomain.com/hosted/student1/index.html`
- `http://yourdomain.com/hosted/project_demo/index.html`

### Hosting Process

#### Step 1: Click Host Button
- Click the "🌐 Host" button next to any student submission

#### Step 2: Choose URL Path
- System suggests a path based on student name (e.g., "john_smith")
- You can customize it to anything you want
- Use only letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens

#### Step 3: Automatic Deployment
- System extracts the project files
- Deploys them to the specified URL
- Shows you the live link

#### Step 4: Share with Others
- Copy the live URL and share it with students, colleagues, or anyone
- Projects are fully functional VR experiences
- No download or installation required

### Features

#### ✅ **Instant Deployment**
- Projects go live immediately after hosting
- No manual file management required
- Automatic extraction and deployment

#### ✅ **Custom URLs**
- Choose meaningful paths like `/student-name` or `/project-title`
- Easy to remember and share

- Direct sharing of URLs

#### ✅ **Overwrite Protection**
- If a URL path is already used, it gets replaced
- No duplicate hosting issues
- Easy to update projects

### Management

#### **View Hosted Projects:**
- Hosted projects show "🌐 Hosted" status on dashboard
- Click "View Live Project" to open in new tab
- Share the URL with anyone

#### **Update Hosted Projects:**
- Re-host the same project to update it

#### **File Organization:**
```
vr_hotspots/
├── hosted-projects/
│   ├── john_smith/          # Student's hosted project
│   │   ├── index.html
│   │   ├── script.js
│   │   ├── style.css
│   │   └── config.json
│   ├── project_demo/        # Another hosted project
│   └── class_showcase/      # Class presentation project
```

### Production Deployment

#### **For Public Access:**
1. **Deploy server** to cloud hosting (Heroku, DigitalOcean, AWS)
2. **Configure domain** (e.g., vrprojects.schoolname.edu)
3. **Student projects** become accessible at:
   - `https://vrprojects.schoolname.edu/hosted/student1/index.html`
   - `https://vrprojects.schoolname.edu/hosted/best-projects/index.html`

#### **Security Considerations:**
- Hosted projects are **publicly accessible**
- Only host projects you want to be public
- Consider adding authentication for sensitive content
- Monitor storage usage for large deployments

### Technical Details

#### **Server Requirements:**
- Node.js with Express
- Unzipper package for ZIP extraction
- File system access for hosting directory

#### **Storage:**
- Each hosted project uses disk space
- Monitor `hosted-projects/` directory size
- Clean up old projects as needed

#### **Performance:**
- Projects load directly from server filesystem
- Fast serving of VR content
- Scales with server resources
